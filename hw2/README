Gaussian elimination w/o pivoting

Sequential implementation: gauss.c
To compile: "make seq" 
To run: ./gauss <Matrix size> <Random Seed>

MPI implementation: gaussMPI.c
To compile: "make MPI" 
To run: mpiexec -n <N> ./gaussMPI <Matrix Size> <Random Seed>
here N is the number of processes to spawn.
** OPTIMIZED @ N = # of cores on node; On Jarvis N = 8 **
With output file: ./gaussMPI <Matrix Size> <Random Seed> <filename>

Pthreads implementation: gaussPt.c
To compile: "make Pt" 
To run: ./Pthreads <Matrix Size> <Random Seed>
** OPTIMIZED @ global var nthreads = # of cores on node; On Jarvis nthreads = 8 **
With output file: ./Pthreads <Matrix Size> <Random Seed> <filename>
