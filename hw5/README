Homework 5: Matrix Normalization via CUDA

Sequential Implementation
matrixNorm.c = Sequential implementation of normalization algorithm
Compilation: 
	make
Run:
	./matrixNorm <Matrix-Size> <Random-Seed>

CUDA Implementation
matrixNorm.cu = CUDA implementation of the normalization algorithm
Compilation:
	make cuda
Run: 
	./matrixCuda <Matrix-Size> <Random-Seed>

Results
The results are in the ./results directory
with names cuda*.txt and seq*.txt for cuda and
sequential implementations respectively.
